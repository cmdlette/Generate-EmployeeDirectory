# Generate-EmployeeDirectory
This is a PowerShell script that builds an HTML employee directory page intended for use as an embed in a web page.

It pulls attributes including thumbnail photo, name, phone number, and email address, from Active Directory, and builds them into a table.

# CSS for the Employee Directory
I wrote some quick CSS to make the resulting HTML page look nicer than the default HTML table styling. You'll likely want to change to your own color theme.

# Things to know
You'll want to read through and change out the paths so that they work in your environment. I have only provided placeholder paths. Additionally, if you want to add or remove columns, be sure to add or remove table headers in the correct places.
